#About the Pokémon App Project

Changed Repository name from cf_js_01_june2022 to Pokemon_App
Project started as a US Congress representative trade tracker, but due to limitations with the API data,
I changed to the standard Pokémon API normally used for the assignment.

I organized Pokémon data by name.  Names are added to clickable buttons which load a pop-up window with more information
fetched from the Pokémon API.
